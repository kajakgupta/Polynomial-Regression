## Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a **dependent** (target) and **independent variable (s)** (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the [causal effect relationship](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/06/establish-causality-events/) between the variables.
